# Exercise

- Start a NextJS project.
- Create a GET route on /api/greetings with a first_name parameter that returns a simple "Hello ${first_name}!" in the payload key of a JSON object.
- Create a POST route on /api/create_user that takes a JSON object with a firstName and a lastName keys and returns those keys and the values fully capitalized into the payload key of a JSON object. Your API needs to return usable errors for everything that could go wrong (missing parameters, not found route, wrong method...)
- Write a small series of tests. Choose your weapon for the tests.
- Update your code on GitHub
- Deploy the result on vercel.com (on the free tier)
- Send me the github URL, the test command, and the deployment URL => fabien@green-got.com
- If it passes the basic tests, we setup a meeting to talk about your code.
- Then you talk to the others to check that you are a good fit. If you are, you're hired.
